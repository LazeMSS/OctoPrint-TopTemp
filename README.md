# TopTemp
![](extras/main.png)<br/>
A [OctoPrint](https://github.com/foosel/OctoPrint) plugin that will show you the temperatures in the navbar/topbar of OctoPrint. It can display the hotend, chamber, all tools/hotends and also add an unlimited number of your own “top widgets” for example showing cpu temperature, fan speed - well anything that is a number (for now) that you can get back from running a command.

It can all be customized and setup to fit your needs:
* Add a small background graph to show the history
* Customizable “widgets” can have different run intervals 
* Show temperature in Celsius or Fahrenheit
* Hide printer temperatures when not operational
* Set padding between each and outer margin
* Sort the order of the “widgets”
* Show target temperature
* Show target progress aka getting hotter or colder
* Show temperature symbol
* Set label or no label to be shown
* Icon or no icon to be shown
* Colorize icons to indicate when hot
* Number of digits to display
* Set background graph transparency, height, line width and color
* Realtime preview

## Planned features
* Popover with extra information/history and full graph
* Set lowpoint for custom graphs
* Small font options
* Max width per "widget"
* More custom/predefined tools: Wifi signal, Disk space, Fan speed, CPU percentage
* Custom option to set as not a temperature (no fahrenheit conversion and no check for number)
* Custom option postfix label (rpm etc)

## Setup
Install via the bundled [Plugin Manager](https://github.com/foosel/OctoPrint/wiki/Plugin:-Plugin-Manager)
or manually using this URL:

## Configuration
Install and read the onscreen information - it should be pretty self-explanatory else play with it :)

## Custom commands special
The custom commands allow you to run any OS command by entering a command into the “Command” field. There is a Test button that will run the command and let you validate the returned data. At the moment the returned data has to be a number (float or integer) and will be fixed
If the plugin has detected any known ways of finding interesting data on startup this will be shown in Predefined dropdown button.
At the moment it only looks for known CPU temperature, but if you know of any good generic ways to display interesting data then post it here https://github.com/LazeMSS/OctoPrint-TopTemp/issues

## 3RD Party software
